= PrimitiveGroupCentroid =

"""Create points at the centers of primitive groups."""

This node creates points at the centers of primitive group, or groups of
primitives with unique *name* or *class* attributes.

The centers of groups can be calculated using the barycenter, boundingbox
center, or the center of mass.

When points are connected provided through the second input, these points
will use their source identifier to match to the incoming geometry and
transform the incoming geometry based on standard Houdini
[copy/instance behaviour|/copy/instanceattrs].

Attributes can also be copied to/from the centroid points. Primitive
attribute values will be averaged onto the centroid points.  Point
attributes from the binding points will be copied as primitive attributes
to the corresponding input geometry.

@parameters

Mode:
    The method used to partition the geometry for centroid calculations.

    Group:
        Use specified primitive groups.
    Name:
	Use each group of named primitives.
    Class:
	Use each group of primitive classes.

Group:
    When mode is set to *Group*, specify the group(s) to act on.

Method:
    The centroid calculation method.

    Barycenter:
        Use the average point position.
    Bounding Box:
        Use the center of the bounding box of the geometry.
    Center of Mass:
	Use the calculated center of mass.

Store Source Identifier:
    Create an attribute on the points that indicates the source of each
    centroid.

Attribute to Copy:
    Attributes to copy from the primitives to the centroid points.  The
    attribute values are averages.

Unmatched Behavior:
    When transforming the geometry, determine what to do for groups that
    have no matching transform points.

    Keep:
        Keep the groups and apply no transforms.
    Destroy:
	Destroy the geometry.

Bind Attribute to Copy:
    Attributes to copy from the binding points to the matching geometry.
    The attributes are copied as Primitive attributes.

@inputs
Source:
    Geometry to generate centroids for.
Template:
    (Optional) Transform the source geometry by matching points.
