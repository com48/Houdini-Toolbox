= PrimitiveCentroid =

"""Create points at the centers of primitives."""

This node creates points at the centers of primitives. These points have 
their normal value set to the normal of the source primitive.  Specific
attributes can also be copied.

@parameters
    Method:
	The type of calculation to use when computing the centroid.
    
	Barycenter:
	    Use the average point position of each point in the primitive.
	Bounding Box:
	    Use the bouding box of the primitive.

    Attributes to Copy:
	Primitive attributes to copy to the center points.

@inputs
Source:
    Primitives to generate centroids for.
